Hello. 

So we decided to code our website in public. Yaay!! 

Apparently, we are aware of the fact that there's a lot of stuff to learn from the web community and we hope by sharing our source, we can get construtive ideas on how to write better code and learn new techniques.

Feel free to comment and clone this repo.

Cheers!
